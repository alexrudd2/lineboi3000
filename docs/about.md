## What Is This

Li'l app for drawing stuff and sending it to a Pen Plotter.

Beta, still heavily under construction, but should generally work. So far I've tested it on a Macbook Air (early 2015) with:

-   Pen Plotter: `AXIDraw V3`
-   Node Version: `12.17.0`
-   Yarn Version: `1.22.4`
-   NPM Version: `6.14.4`
