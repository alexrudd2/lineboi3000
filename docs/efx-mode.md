![layer controls](_media/efx-mode-add-filter.png ':class=docsImg')

Click left or right to select the layer you want to add. You can also click the filter name to see a list of all available filters, and then click one to auto-add.

`ADD`: Add the selected filter to the current layer

## Filters

### Single Filter

![single filter](_media/efx-mode-one-filter.png ':class=docsImg')

The arrows move the filter up or down in the list of filters. The X deletes the filter from the current layer.

`ON`/`OFF` enables or disables the layer. An `OFF` filter remains in the list but will not be used to process lines.

#### Filter Options

Each filter has various options that can adjust the intensity or details of the output. add link here
